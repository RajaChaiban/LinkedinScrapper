# LinkedIn AI Scraper

This repository contains a complete full-stack application for a LinkedIn Scraper Dashboard, generated using Stitch and enhanced with a Python backend.

## Structure

### 1. Frontend (`/frontend`)
*   **Tech**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Purpose**: A modern, mobile-responsive dashboard generated by Stitch. It allows users to configure scrape parameters (Company, Location, Keywords) and launch the AI agent.
*   **Key File**: `src/App.jsx` contains the logic to capture user input and communicate with the backend.

### 2. Backend (`/backend`)
*   **Tech**: Python, FastAPI.
*   **Purpose**: Acts as the orchestration layer for the AI Agent.
*   **Logic**: 
    *   `main.py`: Exposes a REST API (`POST /launch`) for the frontend.
    *   `agent.py`: Contains the `LinkedInAgent` class. Currently a mock, but designed to be the integration point for Apify or other scraping libraries.

### 3. Tests (`/tests`)
*   **Tech**: Playwright, Pytest.
*   **Purpose**: End-to-end UI testing to ensure the dashboard works as expected.
*   **Test**: `test_ui.py` automates a user flow: opening the app, filling the form, selecting a mode, and clicking "Launch".
